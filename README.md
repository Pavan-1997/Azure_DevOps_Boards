### What is a Work Item:
A work item can track all types of activities. It could be a

*  A bug to fix,
*  An issue
or anything that we can assign to people and keep track of the progress.

## Kanban Board 

Kanban is a visual method for managing and optimizing work items. In simple terms, it is a visual board that helps teams keep track of their tasks and work more efficiently. It can be divided into multiple stages such as **todo, in-progress, and done**.

## Azure Boards Processes

1) **Basic**: Choose Basic when your team wants the simplest model that uses Issues, Tasks, and Epics to track work.
2) **Agile**
3) **Scrum**
4) **CMMI**

The basic process contains three work item types:
- Epics: Group your more significant items into Epics such as Website updates, Cloud migration, CICD implementation
- Issues: Further divide your Epics into Issues such as Homepage, about us page, secure sign-in
- Task: Tasks are the smallest amount of work that can be assigned to someone, for example, designing a homepage header, standardizing fonts, and fixing the homepage CSS to make it mobile responsive.
