or anything that we can assign to people and keep track of the progress.

## Kanban Board 

Kanban is a visual method for managing and optimizing work items. In simple terms, it is a visual board that helps teams keep track of their tasks and work more efficiently. It can be divided into multiple stages such as **todo, in-progress, and done**.

## Azure Boards Processes

- Issues: Further divide your Epics into Issues such as Homepage, about us page, secure sign-in
- Task: Tasks are the smallest amount of work that can be assigned to someone, for example, designing a homepage header, standardizing fonts, and fixing the homepage CSS to make it mobile responsive.
